## Definition

Machine learning is part of the broader field of artificial intelligence. This field is concerned with the capability of machines to perform activities using human-like intelligence. Within machine learning there are several different kinds of tasks or techniques:
> 1. In **supervised learning**, every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values. We will explore this in-depth in this lesson.
> 2. In **unsupervised learning**, there are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data. We will explore this in-depth in this lesson.
> 3. In **reinforcement learning**, the algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal. This is a completely different approach than supervised and unsupervised learning. 

## How is Machine Learning Different from Traditional Learning?

In traditional programming, a person manually creates a solution in code, which can be complex and impractical for problems with many edge cases. For example, detecting a cat in an image would require coding for various conditions and scenarios.

In machine learning, the approach is different: a model is trained using data and a training algorithm to handle these complexities. The trained model can then make predictions or identify patterns without needing explicit coding for every possible situation. Essentially, machine learning automates pattern recognition and statistical reasoning to solve problems.

## Nearly all tasks solved with machine learning involve three primary components:
1. A machine learning model
2. A model training algorithm
3. A model inference algorithm

> The 'Clay Analogy' explaining these primary components is as follows -
Raw Clay: Represents the initial, flexible data or model. First, you start with a block of raw clay. At this stage, the clay can be molded into many different forms and be used to serve many different purposes. You decide to use this lump of clay to make a teapot.
Inspection and Analysis: Involves examining the raw clay (data) to determine how to shape it. You inspect and analyze the raw clay and decide how to change it to make it look more like the teapot you have in mind.
Molding: Refers to the process of adjusting and refining the clay (data/model) to achieve the desired outcome, like shaping it into a teapot (model).
